Description: A supra-hexagonal map is a giant hexagon on a 2-dimensional grid
    seamlessly consisting of smaller hexagons. It is supposed to train, analyse and
    visualise a high-dimensional omics input data. The supraHex is able to carry
    out gene clustering/meta-clustering and sample correlation, plus intuitive
    visualisations to facilitate exploratory analysis. More importantly, it allows
    for overlaying additional data onto the trained map to explore relations between
    input and additional data. So with supraHex, it is also possible to carry out
    multilayer omics data comparisons. Newly added utilities are advanced heatmap
    visualisation and tree-based analysis of sample relationships. Uniquely to
    this package, users can ultrafastly understand any tabular omics data, both
    scientifically and artistically, especially in a sample-specific fashion but
    without loss of information on large genes.
