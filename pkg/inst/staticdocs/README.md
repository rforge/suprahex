## Introduction

`supraHex` is an open-source package for tabular omics data analysis using a supra-hexagonal map. The supra-hexagonal map is a giant hexagon on a 2-dimensional map grid seamlessly consisting of smaller hexagons. It intends to meet the need for quickly understanding genome-wide biological data, which usually involve a large number of genomic coordinates (e.g. genes) but a much smaller number of samples. 

`supraHex` first uses a supra-hexagonal map to self-organise the input omics data, and then post-analyses the trained map for integrated tasks: simultaneous analysis of genes and samples, and multilayer omics data comparisons.

## Features

* An integrated framework for the ultrafast understanding of any tabular omics data, both scientifically and artistically
* The supra-hexagonal map trained via a self-organising learning algorithm
* Visualisations at and across nodes of the map
* Partitioning of the map into gene meta-clusters
* Sample correlation
* Overlaying additional data onto the trained map for exploring relationships between input and additional data
* This package can run on Windows, Mac and Linux
